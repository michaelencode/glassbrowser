fetch browser history and take screenshot for partner for review your online behavior
A friend of mine requested that I build a program to help him resist the temptation of viewing NSFW content. He wants a tool that can track his browser activity and send a report of his browsing habits to a trusted friend via email. This way, he can have accountability and support in his efforts to avoid viewing inappropriate material.

The program will take screenshot by schedule. Meanwhile, the browser history will be analyzed. All the suspected NSFW content will be sent to designed email receipts. 
Privacy Policy: To protect your privacy, The screenshots will be compressed and blurred. Most of the data computing will be processed on local machine. in the future, the unidentified URLs will be uploaded to continue natural language processing after stripping the parameters. After sending email, all content will be delete.
